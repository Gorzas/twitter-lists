# My Twitter lists

A quick script to transform a CSV into some tweets for making lists. This case as an example was used for the hashtag #AlertaWAM2018 to publish my suggested bands for WAM Festival.

## TODO

- Add example of usages and results
- Change the results to be configurable (hashtags, mentions...)
- Add control version system
- Change main library to use
